1. build a view logic to displaying detailed messages was sent, the data are alvailable on messages table.
2. For each message that has been sent, separate each session and then wrap each session like a dropdown which if clicked will appear a detailed list of the session by displaying a maximum of 10 data, also apply pagination so that it is not too heavy to consume.
3. you can access all migration file and model to determine the structure.
4. In the details of each message, display the name, no_hp, date sent (in humanize format) and status, all contained in the database
5. I've created it on pages.session_details.blade.php, but it still seems to be imperfect, so it doesn't show any data
6. you should build this code at MessagesInsight controller
